# MicroPython - The Pythonic Internet of Things

I gave this talk at PyGrunn 2016. It's a gentle introduction to MicroPython for Python developers.

The file huzzah-demo.py contains some commands I showed on a [Huzzah Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview) board, and the online-demo.py
contains commands I executed on [micropython.org/live](http://micropython.org/live).
